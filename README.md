This unit gives an overview of mobile robot systems, technologies and algorithms. It covers various types of mobile robots, including driving robots, walking and balancing robots, unmanned aerial vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles and autonomous boats. The units builds a theoretical background on robot kinematics, localisation, mapping and navigation and transforms this into working robot algorithms during practical labs. The unit concludes with the topics robot vision, artificial intelligence and driverless vehicles.
